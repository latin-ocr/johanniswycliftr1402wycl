the difficulty, which might for a time be more satisfactory to some of
his pupils. 'l‘hey were free to grant that universals might be countcd
apart from their singulars, though in reality one with them3 or to dcny
it, because they are not different things. “But 1‚³³ says Wyclif, at tl1e
close of the chapter, “stick to my first antwer’³ (l. 30). If the name of
Doctor Evangelicus had not been given to him, he might have deserved,
as well as if not better than Dumnclus, the title of Doclor Resolu-
tissimus.

Chapter III. Under cover of investigating the nature of disjunctive
propositions, Wyclif continues the debate on Universals, and now pro-
ceeds to carry the war into the enemy's country in a very practical
way: vil„ by asserting that the very idea osa promise demonstrates
the trutli of his theory. But we must first of all briessy note how he
gets to this subject. The proposition which contradicts a disjunctive is a
copulative of which both parts are contradictory to the former: as, A is Β
or A is C: contr. A is not Β and A is not C (p. 56, l. ὁ, 7). Now
and A may be replaced by and it: so here. as in the foregoing chapter,
comes the question; for what do pronouns stand? In other words, ought
the Realist or the Nominalist view to prevail? Only here the field of
discussion is restricted and specified. Ι promise a penny. There is there-
fore 3 penny <which Ι promise. Does this which relate to a universal
penny, or to a singular one? Wyclif at once and of course chooses the
first alternative. He says that, if anything singular is meant, not only
philosophy, but politica} science and even all human untercourse must
go by the board. And not only the act of promising becomes impossible,
but purchase, sale, donations, acts of justice, rewards and punishments
are rendered null and void. When Ι promise a penny, α penny, according
to Nominalists‚ is a mere empty word, there being no universal penny,
but only singular ones3 and so the promise becomes ineffective (p. 58),
One man owes another οἳ 20. According to Nominalists‚ even God's
Almighty power could not make him pay. There may be and are parti-
cular sums called Ξ 20; but such a general promise of what is but a
flatus vocis in itself can have no value. And so on with many other
cases, which all result in constructive absurdities; constructive of course,
for, rightly or wrongly, they were denied by the partisans of the opposite
system. Wyclif therefore declares (p. 59, l. 20) that we are obliged to

admit the ancient doctrine of Universals‚ and closes his case with
