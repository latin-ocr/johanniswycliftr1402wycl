words having the looks of propositions,kbut not their nature. They are
not absurd merely; an absurdity is not quite unmeaning; leis square
is round, clearly means an impossibility‚ and its denial is evidently true.
Not incoherent: lee number three is fragrant, does not even seem to
mean anything but the raving of a lunatic, which no one cares to deny. Not
mere gibberish: Blitri is Blaflzro may be equally well denied or affir—
med‚ nobody knowing what they are, The so-called propositions in
question are in reality a peculias class of pseudo-propositions: words
which appear to have a meaning, but which falsify both themselves and
their contradictories‚ And this, Ι think, would be quite enough to satisfy
modern students of logic.

The idea osso simple and easy a solution did not, it would seem,
strike any of Wyclif's contemporaries3 and he himself, though coming ¹
nearest to it in my opinion, does not quite hit the mark. Some of them
affirmed that such propositions were neither false nor true (p. 194.
l. 24-37). Some, that they were both true and false (p. 194, 1. 38 10
p. 195, 1. 14). Others, that they were in reality exceptive propositions,
as no proposition can include itself in its own meaning (p. 195, l. 14 to
p. 196, l. 20). Some said that the words implied contradiction if under-
stood as they were, but they did not explain how they were to be un-
derstood otherwise (p. 196, l. 20 to p. 197, l. 20). And others again
denied that such words as proposilion. lrm’. salse, SIC„ could receive
universal extension (p. 197, 1. 20 to p. 199, l. 9). Several other opinions
are enumerated besides (pp. 199-203). Wyclif taking the material or
grammatica] side of the definition osa proposition, saw that both subject
and predicate had meaning apart, and that they were joined by a copula;
he naturally could not see his way to denying that in such cases there
was no proposition. But then, how could it be one, 11 it had no meaning,
if it neither affirmed nor denied anytbing? Wyclif’s answer (p. 203 to
end of work), comes to pretty nearly the same as the one I have given
above. It is nol a proposition in the ordinary sense of the word, for, in
this ordinary sense, it has absolutely no meaning. But it exists. Whatever

existS, means its own existence. In that sense, every such proposition is
