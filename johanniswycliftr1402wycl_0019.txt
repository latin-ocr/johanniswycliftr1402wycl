saith and not reason should make us believe in them. If they are not,
they destroy the mysterious nature of the 'l‘rinity itself.'³ lt is perhaps
as an answer to this objection, never stated in so many words, that our
author in several passages os his works (and in particular a few pages
further, pp. 51, 52) takes care to note the differences between the
Universal and the Dii-ine Essence. But he only points out other myste-
ries, and leaves the llmt wlzicli distinction untouehed, as parallel in both
cases. ——- The serious difficulty, viz„ that universals must move about, as
they are wherever their singulars happen to be, is taken into earnest
consideration (p. 47). Wyelif inclines to think that they move; at the
same time he denies that this implies localization of the Universal.
Fourllt. The most difficult point of all, where the writer seems to
be most uncertain, and which he probably developed and explained at
a later period, is, “How the Universals can be said to make up a
number with their singulars'³. If the individual man A and the universal
man are identical‚ they are not two⁷ but one; if, on the other hand, there
is a real distinction between them, they must be two realities‚ ancl be
counted as such (p. 48, l. 3—10). It seems impossible to get a satis-
factory answer to this objection3 at least that contained in the present
work seems to me rather lame, so far as I have succeeded in under-
standing it; and when Ι collated the chapter ofDe Um'zzersalibns. “Quo-
modo universalia ponunt in nunie1·o‚’³ I was too busy with the collation
itself to pay much attention to the manner in which Wyclif supplements
what seems wanting here. Fora man of our author's skill and subtlety‚
it would have been very easy to wrap up his answer in a string of
sentences impossible to understand, and signifying anything —- or nothing;
such a mode of proceeding would have been not without great precedents
even in his time3 and contemporary philosophers might perhaps tell us
whether it has been quite abandoned at the present day. But Wyclifi often
unintelligible when pursuing some of his favourite theories out of sight, is
never so on purpose to enibarrass an adversm-y. He may be lost in the
clouds; he does not hide himself in mists. His sturdy English nature prefers
momentary sels-contradiction to wilful ambigusty, and remains in seeming
absurdity until such time as he can get a satisfactory reply to what per-
plexes him. This, I believe, will appear a little further, 1 do not think

that it takes anything away from the admiration (lue to his talent.v and
