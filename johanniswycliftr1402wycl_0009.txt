INTRODUCTION.

All details concerning the manuscript (Univ. Prag. V. E. 14) and
the authenticity and (late of the work itself having been discussed at
sufficient length in the Introduction to the first volume, we may at once
proceed to examine the second with regard to its contents alone. It
comprises the first eight chapters of the third treatise of Logt'ccss or
more properly of [logicae Conlinualio. Wyelif goes over the same ground
three times, it may be remembered: once in his Summary, or short
abstract of Logic; a second time, with much greater developments‚ in
the first and second treatises of Logt'cae continuatio: and once again in
the work which forms the second and third volumes of the present
edition: in ει most exhaustive manner this time⁷ and treating of a variety
of questions which often seem quite irrelevant to the science of Logic..
It is true that in this third treatise Wyclif ostensibly (leals with hypo-
thetical propositions alone, and that he leaves out, or expounds only
parenthetically, many questions already quite threshed out in his first
volume. The difference, however, is to a great extent nominal. Both
categorical and hypothetical propositions are for the most part as mere
headings of chapters‚ or as texts from which Wyclis preachcs his system
with greater or less detail. In the third treatise‚ the matter is thus really
the same, but approached from a different standpoint, and expounded for
more advanced students. Perhaps some apology will be necessary for
the very detailed summary that is to follou⁷; if so, I may say that l
thought it would not be quite useless to go thoroughly through the first
work in which Wyclif's system is set forth as a whole, and of which
the other philosophical treatises are hut modifications and dex*elopments⁸
