Is there any miclcourse between this doctrine and that of such Realists
as affirm that there is in man a humanity corresponding to our idea,
and really identical in all its singulam? There is; it is the theory of
Moderate Realists. To ascribe the universality of our ideas to a mere
groundless 11611011 of the mind would destroy the objective value of all
reasoning. To suppose that there exists a mysterious something, substan-
tially identical in each and all of 1116 singular objects that come under 3
general name, would land us in endless difficulties, with which we shall
soon 566 wyclif attempting· to grapple. They therefore draw 3 sharp
distinction between the Universal, as not seen by the mind, and 35 seen.
The Universal‚ 35 formally 61115113ςέΓ 111 many singulars, is nowhere but in
the mind. Everything that exists in nature is foi-mally concrete, and sin-
gular in its essence. Thus the UniversaL as known, is nothing but a
mere abstraction. But, as able· lo be known. it is otherwise3 it is 1631;
13 63611 singular it exists as 3 basis from which our mind is ableto
abstract the universal idea. Their definition says of the Universal (as
known) that it exists formaliter in menle, fundamenlalitei· in re. They
avoid defending 3 position which they consider unsase, and take up one
which it is very difficult to attack with any chance of success, Asked by
Nominalists if the rcdness of the rose, the geranium, and the cherry, is
3 1631 universal, they reply: Its reality is formally in the objects, funda-
mentally in the mind3 its universality is formally in the mind, fundamen-
tally in the objects. Asked by those of Wyclif's school if there is nothing
identical in two shades of 6010111· 13 which there is no (1111616366, they
answer: Nothing but the aptitude they have for being grasped in one
i‹ls·a; that aptitude, in objects similarly coloured, really exists3 and when
our mind thus grasps them, it becomes actual — but only in the mind.
This may seem obscure, but I can find no words to state it more
clearly: and indeed this seems to 136 the true 'solution of the whole
problem. Ι (10 301 566 1ν1131 1116 most determined Nominalist could sind

not satisfy him; for it keeps up a strict relation between signs, ideas,
and things, between the subjective and the objective order, and maintains
the validity of human reason without restrictions, in whatever §phere il
