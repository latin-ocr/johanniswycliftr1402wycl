XXXYI INTRODUCTION.

satellites (potest . . . aliquid subito moveri et multiplicari per quotlibet
loca (p. 144, 1. 2-4).1 We have to consider, not what assistance God
could absolutely give to His creatures‚ but what He gives them naturally
and according to His Divine plan. To this there must be a maximum
limit; it is that of the creature's ability to act with such assistance (p, 145,
l. 13 to p. 146, l. 12).

Can God create worlds indefinitely? If He could, then we are com-
pelled to posit an infinite and absurd vacuum beyond our world. These
worlds, however multiplied we may conceive them to be, would form a
body infinitely small in comparison with the enormous vacuum 5111101111-
ding it. We should then find one infinite magnitude to be greater than
another: which is a flat absurdity. This difficulty is absolutely unanswer-
able. An endless vacuum entails quite as many absurdities as the hypo-
thesis ofa body infinitely great, Yet God, though thus seemingly limited
in power, remains Almighty, for His power is limited only by Himself.
He eternally produces an infinitely perfect act (the Word); and above
all, creation implies omnipotence. Yet creation could not take place-but
at a certain fixed point of duration3 nor could the world be larger or
5111111161Α than it is. Some, refusing to admit these limitations‚ lay down
as a principle that God's omnipotence extends to eyerything that we
are able to maintain that He can d‹·›; and that He can thus grant an
indefinite amount os assistance to any created faculty. This, as Wyclif
points out, is a grossly unfair method of reasoning. He does not however
deny that God could render such assistance, if He chose; but says that,
not choosfflg, He cannot (pp. 146—152).

a certain time C, this being the maximum which it can bear, it could

evidently bear a heavier weight for a shorter time; again, during this

esset motus localis corporis. Nullus autem motus localis corporis potest esse in
instanti: quia omne quod movetur localiter, necesse est quod prius perveniat ad
medium magnitudinis quam ad extremum. illuminatio autem fit in instanti: uec potest
