XXXVIII INTRODUCTION.

nerally believed that Schoolmen denied the existence of atoms. It would
be more correct to say that they passed them over. They of course
combated the systems of Democritus and Epicurus3 and, finding that the
system of matter and form sufficed to explain in metaphysical terms all
that was then known of natural phenomena, they generally did not trouble
themselves to enquire if atoms were or were not true in any other sense.
St. Thomas, however, certainly says that there is and must be a limit
to the divisibility of any corporeal substance; but he goes no farther.¹
Wyclif‚ with his principle that a limit not reached is not a limit, cannot
help admitting atoms (p, 163, l. 13—22. He gramm, in answer to
objections made, that the combination or decomposition of two atoms is
instantaneous; hut this does not prevent the chemical change of the whole
from taking up a certain time (p. 163, l. 23—313 p. 164‚ l. 13—31). To the
well-known difficulty, urged even in our days by Ultra-Thomists against
such Neo-Scholastics as believe in a ‘minimum naturale³, viz„ that such
a theory would reduce compound bodies to mere aggregates, similar to
so many heaps of sand, he denies the conclusion in the case of organic
bodies, which have a supervening form that gives unity to the whole;
but whether homogeneous inanimate substances are mere aggregates is,
he says, a doubtful point (p. 163, 1. 31—41; p. 164, l. 31 to p. 165,
l. 37). Division is favourable to chemical changeg and on that account
alchemists calcine metals, to give them tln,¹ inore perfect forms (v. g.
that of gold, or ‘aureity³). But, as this calcination does not reduce the
inetals to their ultimate parts, the successful result of their experimentis
is ever a matter of chance, — We have thus: 1⁵l ‚ the elementary forms
in the atoms, and 2¹¹³, those of the compound: simple in themselves,
these forms are to a certain degree extended in the bodies of the lower
animals‚ which accounts for their continuing to live, although divided
into several parts. As for monsters with double organs, they are pro-
perly two animals joined in one, and possess two forms, or vital prin-
ciples (p. 165, l. 37 to p. 167, l. 34).

ledge, there can be no limit3 for the more we know, the more able we
