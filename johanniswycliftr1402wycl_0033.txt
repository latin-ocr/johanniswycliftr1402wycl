INTRODUCTION. XXIX

because of clouds that arise from the earth itself. 111 like manner, Cod's
not willing me to do good (if He willed it, Ι should do good without
fail) would proceed from an obstacle on my part — my non-reception os
His grace; just as in the case of the sun's rays. What is not received
cannot possibly be given. But I an responsible sor not receiving it
through my fault (p. 107, l. 8 to p. 108, l. 20).

So far, sin and its possibility and origin is explained in the ortho-
dox way, and reconciled with God's First and absolute Causality. But
Wyclif closes the chapter with one or two sentences which, evenis
defensible, have a somewhat strange sound. God cannot but be the
First Cause of all; and therefore, though indirectly, of every act, in-
cluding sin: of the eternal truth that whatever is able to sin may sin at
some time or other; of the creation of such peccable beings; and also
os the very happeniug (contingentiae, p. 108, 1. 33) of the act, which is
thus radically dependent upon God. We must, however, remark that there
is no attempt to fix the sinfulness of any act upon God. On the con-
trary, says Wyclif, in so far as God is the author of sin, sin is good.
Whatever is true is good; and the possibility of every sin depends
upon the everlasting truth already laid down. Thus we have a logica
deduction as follows:

A, R, C ..... Z are severally ablc lo sin.
We suppose the crc‘cllion of A. R, C . . . .. Z.

Also that, in Wyclif's system, wlzczl is able lo sin means mlta! (at
one time or other, 01· [in one subject or other) will actually commit
sin‚· for able lo does not signify mere abstract possibility, but the ne-
cessity of a future happening.

'l‘hen we necessarily have that either A, 01¹ Β, ον C ..... ον Ζ

will at some instant ον ollzcr os all lime (either the instant α, or la, or

c . or z) actually commit sin.

Here we see, not only that there is 110 necessity for any of the
given singulars taken in particular A, B, C, &a to sin at all, but also
that it is not necessary that the sin should take place at a given instant
of time. And as contingency is the opposite of necessity, we now see
what Wyclif means when he says that sin is of the extremest contingency
(summa contingentia); for the truth would be verilied if only one of the
multitude Α, Β, C, ἃς. sinned but once.
