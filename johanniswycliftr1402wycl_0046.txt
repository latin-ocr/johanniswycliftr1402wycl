XLII lNTRODUCTlON.

false, it proves itself to be true; and consequently false; and so on for
ever. How shall we get out of this?

To make the case plainer, by contrasting it with one somewhat
similar, suppose it is said: No proposition is true. If granted, the pro-
position itself is not true; and being false, some propositions must be
true. Yes, but if denied, no difficulty follows. This is simply an absurdity
akin to the Sceptical position: It is incluln‘table that every proposition is
doubtful. It is only on one side that such utterances resemble insolubles:
the essence of the latter consists in their being equally impossible to
deny or to affirm,

Does a man who swears that he is committing perjury forswear
himself or not? Not unless he speaks the truth3 and if he is speaking
the truth, how can what he says be perjury? Can any one believe that
he is mistaken in that very belief of his mistake?

The puzzle seems still more intricate when a decision has, one
way or the other, to be taken in consequence. A certain Greek rheto-
rician taught his art to a young man, Half his fee was paid down in
advance; the other half was to be paid when, and only when, he gained
his first suit. Time went by, and the young student, having ended his
course of Rhetorie, and not a1j)pearing to plead, was called before the
judges by his teacher. “lf,³³ said the latter, ‘'you win this suit, you
must pay me according to our contract3 if you lose it, the sentence
itself*compels you to pay me.³⁷ ‘l‘he pupil retorted: “If Ι lose, our
agreement sets mc free3 if Ι win, I shall be free by the decision of
the Court.³³

Or the following: A tyrant sets men at a bridge which is his pro-
perty, with the order to ask every passenger whether he will pass or
no, and allow only those to pass who answer truly. If he says: “I shall
pass over,³’ he can either be allowed to pass, or be turned back, and
proved thus to have told an untruth; but what of the man who says:
“I shall not pass?³' If they turn him back, he has spoken the truth, and
they fail in their duty; if they make him pass, they fail equally, for he
has uttered a falsehood.

One last instance. A man has two slaves A and Β. He decides to
free them both, under the following conditions: A is to be free, if the
first man he meets is a slave3 B is to be free only if the first he meets

is a free man. Now it so happens that A and B meet each other before
