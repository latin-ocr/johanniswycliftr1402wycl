INTRODUCTION. XLI

conclusion might be drawn from every proposition (p. loo, l. 4—30).
Wyclif's opinion is that individuation itself proceeds only from the cause
of each individual, and finally from God; but that we know the diffe-
rence between two individuals by their difference in time. Suppose, for
instance, that two sparks exactly alike are struck from a flint succes-
sively, we know their difference because one was struck before the
other (p. 190, l. 30 to p. 191, l⁴ 7). But even God Himself cannot
create the same thing twice ovem nor, by the same reason, can any-
thing be annihilated (et per idem videtur nihil posse annihilari, p. 192,
l. 8, O). Here is the first hesitating assertion of what was later to become
so sirm a doctrine, resulting in a new theory of the Eucharist.

After this. Wyclif comes to the grand question concerning certain
propositions called Insolnhles, on account of the great difficulty which
their solution offered to logicianS. They may in general be put under
the form of a conditional, as follows: If tlte present proposition be lrue,
:l is nof A. This therefore is the best place to deal with them. Before
succinctly giving Wyclif's solution, it may be interesting to state
various forms of so-called insolubles, and the answer which Ι fancy
a modern logician would give, if he troubled himself to find any
solution at all.

If ihc present proposilson ἔνι’ lrne, Α l's nol Α. Grant that this is
exact: an absurdity follows. Deny it, and you have another: It is fitlsc
that, even tf tlte presens proposition be lrnc’, Α is no! Α. We see that a
mere denial of the nexus lands us in a contradiction connected with the
antecedent; whereas its admission grants the contradiction which its
consequent contains. This dialectical puzzle, as is well known, dates
from very early times. In the days of the Greek sophists it took a form
somewhat like this: A certain philosopher said that all Cretans were
liars; but he was a Cretan himself: did he lie, or did he not lie? If he
lied, he spoke the truth; and if he spoke the truth, he lied To say
that a liar may speak the truth sometimes does but elude the difficulty:
for he might have said: “All Cretans always lief' and added the words
“myself included'³‚ to exclude the possibility of an exception being made
in his favour.

This may be expressed much more briefly. Suppose a piecc of
paper, with nothing written on it but: leaf is wrz'lmi llere ssslvzlsc.
