countless parts -— countless, that is, in so far as our mind conceivcs
their multitude. And yet the adversary is driven to deny all this. “I pro—
test before God,” eries Wyclif, indignantly “that of all fallacies ever
invented these seem to me the most worthless!” (p. 82, 1. 6-—28.) — If
our opponents admit that God knows each part of the said infinite
multitudes, he must grant that all these parts exist. Granting this, but
refusing to admit that these parts are separately affirmable, he is at
once met by the fact that, as they exist, they must be beings, singular
beings, and as such affirmable separately. Suppose he takes refuge in
saying that, separately affirmable‚ taken together they are not so; he is
forced from that last refuge by the remark that in that case there must
be a limit to the number of beings which God is able to cognize col-
lectively; and, since a man could count up to any finite number, his
knowledge would be equal to that of God (p. 82, 1. 29 to p. 83, l. 28).

It follows therefore that there exists a maximum number of sin-
gular possible beings (men, for instance), to which nothing can be
added3 and this is true both for simultaneously and successively possible
beings (p. 83, 1. 29 to p. 84, l. 32). Peripateticians, admitting the eternity
of the world, affirm the successive possibility of an endless multitude of
men (p. 84,1. 33 to end). But Christians deny this; some (those of
Wyclif's opinion) asserting a fixed maximum number of every being, all
in ideal and necessary proportion, so that nothing in the world can be
increased or diminished (p. 85, 1. 11-24). This does not limit God’s
power, but affirms His infinite wisdom; how could more men be pro-
duced, when all those who are to exist, exist already? Here, however.
two curious exceptions are made; one in regard to the number of in-
ferior animals (possibly because, not having immortal souls, they would
never simultaneously make up an infinite number), and the other con-
cerning that of human actions, which depend upon free-will and thus
cannot be fixed. Not all future things falce place by necessi& (1. 37, 38),
This is an important sentence, for Wyclif, in his theologica] works, is
known to have maintained a doctrine which seems to contradict this
clear statement of his views. lt may perhaps be interesting to some
future student of this subject to inquire when and how the change of

opinion took place, if it took place at all. It is quite possible that when
