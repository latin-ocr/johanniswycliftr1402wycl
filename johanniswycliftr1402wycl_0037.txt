evil; He is of usc to all3 even his punishments arc not injurious. Nor
can 116 commit moral evil. Wyclif herc (p, 124, 1. 34 to p. 125, 1. 15)
corrects or qualilies what he said :it tlte close of the soregoing chapter·
God cannot make a man to sin; hut when He permits evil, He gives it
an clement of gooclness by the very fact. A man sins; therefore it is
truc (and consequently good) that he sins: God makes the inference,
but does not posit the premiss. Good to all (p. ¹125, 1, 15ψ35), He is
infinitely good in Himself, and finitely so to His creatures. Many things
that we call evil are in reality good; as, for instance, punishments and
niisfortunes (p. 126, 1. 15—20); and in many cases we mistake the value
of things, which varies according to supply and demand (l. 22—--25).
These never can be exactly regulated. Even should the variation in
price not spring from the wickedness of men, it is impossible to fix
prices exactly. We must leave that to nature; the real worth of any-
thing is its utility in the universe. — This is a clear and far-seeing con-
demnation of the many attempts to fix or keep up prices which
were so common during the Middle Ages, and are far from abandoned
even at the present day. In these few sentences we find Free Trade in
its germ.

‘Hindrance’ and ‘obstacle’ generally mean the reverse of utility;
but in a certain sense they may not be evils. If, for instance, God is
said to hinder any one from attaining eternal bliss, it is in order to
work out His plan of the world, in which predestination plays a prin-
cipal part. The natural tendency of all things is to sink to the centre;
but some must be impeded in their descent, or the order of the uni-
verse would perish. Wyclif, however, speaks very guardedly here (forte . . .
difficultates plurimae, p. 128, l. 34 —363 and brings the chapter to a
close without going into any details on this subject.

Chapter VII. Here our author, availing himself of comparative
propositions‚ his nominal subject-matter, deals ex professo with the ques-
tion whether there is for every faculty, or active power, a maximum and
a minimum of intensity beyond which it cannot go either way. Of course
he asserts that there is, and in his answer to the objections, he dis-
cusses various and very diverse questions, including God's omnipotence‚
the limits to human strength, size, and knowledge, the beatific vision,

and our natural faculty of sight.
