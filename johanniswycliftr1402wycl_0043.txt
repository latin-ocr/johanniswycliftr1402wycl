become to increase our knowledge. Nor can there be any limit to th(-
raising of a pile indefinitely high (p. 139, l. 19—30). —- All this is
absolutely denied. We know by saith that the Saints in Heaven (lo really
attain their maximum limit of possible knowledge by means of the
beatific vision of God. The questiothow this can be — a favourite one
both with Mediaeval and with modern Scholastics ›-— is discussed at
some length. The blessed are not infinitely more perfect than we; for
their knowledge is an accidental privilege, not an essential attribute.
Wyclif inclines to think that they see all things in God; but, however
this may be, the essence of felicity consists in the sight of God Himself;
even were they ignorant of something, they would none the less be
perfectly happy (p. 168, l. 10 to p. 174, l. 18). As to the raising of a
pile indefinitely high, of course the higher it went, the more difficult it
would be to raise it any further3 and there would come a point at
which it would exhaust all the powers of the whole human race to get
even one more stone to the summit. Thus, Nature imposes a limit to
men in all things; excessive increase of anything, for instance, of
Clzurclt ceremoniis and posscssiolzs. is hurtful. This is a seed which at
a later period developed into an enm-mous tree (p. 1747 l. 33 to
p. 175, l. 22.

ὁ. A minimum of visibility is absurd. Seeing a sursace, we see
the whole of it, and therefore we confuseslly see all its parts, even to
the infinitely small. — But Wyclif posits as an evident principle that
whatever is seen confusedly might, under other circumstances, be dis-
tinctly seen. This takes all the force out of the objecfflon. A mathe-
matical point cannot be seen distinctly under any circumstances, for the
smallest thing visible must be the base of a pyramid having its apex in
the eye. The chapter comes to a close with some details on the struc-
ture and organistn of the eye, which may be curious as representing
the state of optical science in those days; but I ain not in a position
to discuss them thoroughly; scarcely at all. As Wyclif avowedly takes
most of what he says from the works, not only of Alhazen, but also of the
famous Vitellio <Ciolek> of Cracow, one of the most celebrated opticians
in the Middle Ages, I should have liked to compare his anatomical
description with the summary given by our author. Unfortunately, the
work in question was not in the Jagellonian Library when I asked for

it, having been lent out at some distance from (fi-acon, but the English
