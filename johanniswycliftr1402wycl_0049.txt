true: truc, because it is an existing thing. When we inquire is it has
any truth beyond this, wc are forced to rcpl)¹ in the negative. Λ pro-
position reflected, so to speak‚ back upon itsels‚ can mean nothing but
itsclf3 and in so far as it seems to mean something else, it is false. Thus
every such proposition is both true and false, though in different ways
(p. 205, l. 35, 36). In the case of the tyrant and his bridge, Wyclif
cuts the Gordian knot by shortly stating that such a case would never
happen; and that if it did, the man should be made to pass over (no
doubt because in either case the attendants would fail to do their duty,
and it inattered not what they did). As sor the two slaves, mentioned
above, it is doubtful whether they have not fulfilled the conditions of
freedom imposed by their master; and as the law is in favour of liberty
(eo quod jura faveant libertati> they ought both to be set free (p. 208,
l. 8 to p. 209, l. 24).

A little further, Wyclif explains his theory more clearly still. Let
C stand for the proposition: lec meaning of C is lrtte. This is true in
the sense that C exists. True also, in that it means something, viz„ ilself.
But false, if it be taken to mean anything further (p. 216, 1. 14 to p. 219,
l. 5). Here it is clear that Wyclif, saying that such a proposition is
unmeaning in the third sense, says what amounts to affirming that it is no
proposition at all, as we understand the word nowadays. For him, the word
has a far wider extension. Every thing is a proposition (Log. vol. Ι. p.
15, l. 12—22)‚ because it signilies itself, and makes itself known3 he
cannot therefore refuse to call an ⁵i11soluble³ by that name. But what le
says, stripped of the numerous intrieacies and subtleties which render
this part of his work very dislicult to understand, comeS, Ι think, to
the same.

One word more before we conclude. It is easy to be seen, from
many different answers given to this question, that at Wyciif’s time it was
considered to he a very important and difficult problem; and also that
Wyclif‚ having laboured hard, and in the main successfully, to solve it,
is entitled to the just praise which he felt that he deserved. His closing
words, both modest and dignified, may be quoted here.

«This matter has given me more trouble and occupied 1ne for a
longer space of time than any other part of Logic. Nor do Ι doubt that
every one of the authors of the six above-mentioned theories has also

bestowed much care on the truths which they have discovered relative
