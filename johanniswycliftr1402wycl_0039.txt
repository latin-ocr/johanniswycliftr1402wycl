INTRODUCTION. XXXV

be defeated by any greater force. This is the difference between active
and passive power. Now, in the sense pointed out, either of thes<—
powers is without limit. —fl Wyclis replies that, in the sense given,
passive power is a inere imperfection. If understood to mean receptivity
of forms (as in the case of matter, primordial or other) without doubt
there is a li1nit to that receptivity. Sense-impressions have likewise their
limits, and produce a wrong judgment when the senses are too strongly
stimulated in one particular way. Thence it is clear that our intellect‚
which perceives all things, cannot perceive them by means of any bodily
organ; and also that there is a maximum of receptivity for each of our
senses. Thus, whether active or passive, the power at work is in every
case a for1n; and this form cannot be indefinitely perfect (p. 138, l. 23—303
p. 140, 1. 23 to p. 142, l. 35).

2. God's power would be restricted by this theory; for then,
even by a miracle, He could not make any creature go beyond the
maximum of its power (p. 138, l. 30—38). — Anslver. It is one
thing to know that there are limits even to miraculous assistance, and
another to know what those limits are. God certainly could not, even
by a miracle, make a stone think. His assistance is necessary in every
act, and miraculous assistance only displaces the limit‚ but does not
destroy it (p. 142, l. 36 to p. 143, l. 32). Is there such a thing
as the most rapid movement possible? Wyclif asserts that there is.
As time is made up of indivisible instants‚ so movement also consists
of indivisible degrees of velocity, and the most rapid movement
possible is that which increases at every instant by one such indivisible
degree. This is however, even from Wyclif's point of view, not
the most rapid, but the most rapidly increasing motion possible;
and surely we may suppose that at every instant the mox-emeat might
increase by two degrees of velocity. That would certainly give us a
more rapid motion: but the passage is not very clear, and I am not
quite sure I have understood it rightly. — As for infinitely rapid
movement‚ Wyclif at once sets it down either as impossible (as in the
hypothetica] case given by Aristode, of movement in vacum· sor a
vacuum is an absurdity) or else as not being properly a quantity. Here
our author probably alludes to the instantaneous nature of the movement
of light, a doctrine universally believed before the discovery of the telescope

had rendered possible the celebrated observations on the eclipses ofJupiter's
