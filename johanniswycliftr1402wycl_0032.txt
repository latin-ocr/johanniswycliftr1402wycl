XXVIII INTRODUCTION.

1 am — i. 6. -— infinitely beneath God «- and changes nothing in Him
(pp. 101—103, 1. 8).

And how would Wyclif, according to these lines, have answered
the Hegelian puzzle of the Ego and the Non—Ego? With the utmost ease.
My thinking of an object does not change the object in itself; it only
makes it to be thought. The Non-Ego is the Ego —— 111 my mind. Not
otherwise. My Ego, in thinking — i. e. mentally, is identical with the
Non-Ego; but only in so far. All this is merely a verbal, or if you
prefer, a notional becoming. And the bubble is burst.

From this Wyclif concludes that no inherent accident has any
existence of its own, or adds anything to its substance, as a substance
(p. 103, l. 8—25); that every proposition of which the predicate essen-
tially belongs to the subject infers a causal proposition, but not rice
versu* (for instance: 1111111 is essentialh' rational: man is rational because
lu> is 111011, but, lexis! because God 111113νιψατὶείυιιεε gives no inference;
p. 103, l. 25 to p. 104, 1. 7); that a conclusion from a cause tov the
cause of that cause is a true one (p. 104, l.7 to end); and that, while
God’s will causes my existence in the physical order, my existence causes
God's will to be what it is in the intellectual order, i. 6,, 3 631156. One
of the two gives the entity, but does not prove the existence of the
other; whilst the latter proves the existence of the former, but does not
give it entity (p. 105, l. 1 to p. 100, l. 9'). lt does not follow that either
is prior to the other, unless in two totally different orders: that of
being, and that of cognition (p. 106, 1. 9-25). Νο1 that God’s will,
being a mere relation between the Creator and the Created, cannot
cause anything (l. 26—34). Nor that any creature, to be wssled, must
first of all exist (l. 34-—373 p. 107, l. 1—8).

But can we draw the following negative inference from a causal
proposition: “J do good because God 1111113 ib: llierqsbre‚ {f God does uol
will if, Ido not good because God (locs 1101 will it? It is the very same
form of syllogism as the conclusive one which follows: The day e,r1'sls
Zu‘cause the sun sl11'nes,· llzerqsbre, ts llw sun cloes 1101 suine. the day cloes
uo! <trist because llzc sun cloes uol slziue. Some (1611)> this; others explain the

inference‚ noting that we may suppose. the sun not to shine on the earth¹
