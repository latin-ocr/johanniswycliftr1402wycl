XVI INTRODUCTION.

it makes him respected from another point of view. Hc begins by
enumerating different kinds of number (pp. 48—50)‚ and for some 116
(lenies the possibility of ascribing them ⁴to a universal taken with its
singular. If, however, number be taken to mean all that can be counted, ’
then he admits that the Universal and its singular can be counted toge-
ther, as the Godhead and the Three Pei-sons of the Trinity. Such is
the sense, ifI mistake not, of the words “tune concedendum est. . .
quod quaelibet unitas quae est essentia substantiae singularis est trinitas
suppositorum ejusdem substantiae . . . . et sic [ut] homo communis differt
ab homine singulari, ita essentia communis differt a personis non sic
communibus„ (p. 50, l. 20—28).¹ Here the mystery of the Holy Trinity
stands Wyclif 111 good stead. While he takes care to point out the difference
between the Godhead, as communicable to the Persons, and the Uni-
versal‚ as applicable to its singulars, he says: The numerical difficulty
which you propose to 1116 applies equally to the Divine Essenee, counted
with the Persons; qui nimis probat nihil probczt³³. This would elude the
difficulty3 but Wyclif is not satistied with that. Reverting to the above-
1nentioned case of the Plnrnix, hc :istil-nis that the universal and the

two universals, nor two singulars (l. 20—22)a You cannot say they,
pointing to both at once. (l. 30). The universal Phoenix is in no wisc
other than (aliud vel alia quam, 1. 27, 28) its singular, though they differ
notionally (secundum rationem l. 29). This seems clear enough. Yet if
the universal Phoenix is so identical with its singular that there is a mere
logical distinction between them, and that we cannot even say *between
illem* properly, can we continue to affirm that it possesses a distinct
reality other than that of its singular? ch’ can, answers Wyclif (⁶². . . duo
distincta realiter,” p. 54, l. 10). Eycry universal and its singular are two
things, really different from each other. This looks yery like a contra-
diction in ternis, unless (which is also possible) the text is corrupt. But
Ι do not think so. on account of Wyclif's sudden conclusion of the
debate immediately aster these words, his ayowal that the difficulty is

very great (l. 11, 12) and his pointing out two other ways of answering
