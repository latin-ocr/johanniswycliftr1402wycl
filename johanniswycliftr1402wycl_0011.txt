They might indeed be classilied according to the first principle ol'
abstract Being. For instance: whatever is, is, ancl it is; 1] anything is,
it is; it is wliilsl it is, and so on (p. 3, l. 1—6; p. 7, l. 5—10). But
God's existence is the lirst truth of all3 no other can be known per—
fectly without it, and in that sense it is prior even to the principle of
contradiction, though both are equally primitive as regards tlu· truths
which ssow from them (pp. 7, 8).

Other words might de employed to form new species of hypo-
thetical propositions (p. 3, l. 13—30). But they may always be analyzed
into one of those already given. Neitlzcr -— nor, for instance, means the
same as and with a negative (pp. 8, 9). These propositions may be
combined with each other to the number of 12o; but this does not
increase the number of primary species. For ifI say, A is B if C is D,
because E is F, it is a causal proposition3 but if we have, A is Β, {f
C is D because E is F, the proposition is conditional (pp. 9, 10). Here
Wyelif solves a number of sophisms at considerable length. It was no doubt
useful and even necessary for students os those times to know them; a
the present day, most of us would, for all these sophisms‚ endorse our
author's opinion concerning certain among them, and say with him:
sunt mihi odibiles (p. 14, l. 5). It is, however, worth while to note his
remark that a sentence, however, long it may be, is a proposition, pro-
vided it imply one predominant act of the mind3 where there are several
it is not one proposition, and can neither be affirmed nor denied as
one. The affirmation or negation bears upon the hypothetical sign. God
exisls, ami you are au ass. is denied without any reference to its com-
ponent parts separately (p. 10).

But there seems to haye been a persona] argument, particularly
directed against Wyclif's theory of universals, which may be noticed
apart. We must remember that the universal ⁶‘animal²³‚ in this theory, is
a real thing or entity, identical both in men and in brutes. So we have:
«Yon are now whatever you would be, if you were an ass: in that case
you could bray; therefore you can now.³’ This somewhat humorous
syllogism is gravely discussed, for lt entails grave consequences. wyclif
not only grants that the major premiss is true, but that the minor is
necessary (p. 10⁷ l. 35—41)3 but this is quite natural, if we refer to his
theory. He answers, however, that though a inan is identical with :in

aSS, the identity is only partial. What would bc necessary to conclude
