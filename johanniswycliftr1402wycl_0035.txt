Singulars of the Universal Man, or Humanity.

But it is quite clear that this objection goes to make Wyclif con-
tradict himself. In so far as any man shares more perfectly in humansty,
in so far he shares in it less perfectly! Of course the arguments are
all grossly fallacious; but the subject itself is too important to let them
pass without careful refutation.

In the second place, we may notice the tendency of Scholastic
philosophy to appl)' the mathematical method to metaphysical reasoning.
We have seen cases somewhat similar to this in Logz‘ccz before3 but
nowhere does Wyclif mark it so strongly as here. He even goes the
length of supposing numbers set down to denote the entitative perfec-
tions of diverse species (pp. 119, 120) and points out the fallacy of
reasoning upon such numbers, if they do not stand for homologous
things — I had almost said, quantities: for he evidently has in his
mind the intensity of essential perfection‚ when he numbers them thus.
This seems to have been a tendency more or less to be found in phi-
losophers of all ages, who could not help admiring the fruitful accuracy
of the mathematical method‚ and contrasting it with the barren vaguencss
of their own speculations. Not to speak of the ancients‚ of the school
of Pythagoras, and of several curious passages in Plato and Aristode,
we find a good many traces of this spirit in the works of modern phi-
losophers. Spinoza and Wolff attempted to reduce two very different
systems of philosophy to a series of theorems‚ deduced one from the

other, like those Of Euclid, At the present day, De Morgan, Roole and
