shorter time (Ο) a smaller power, ΔΨ, would be able to bear 11115 53111(-
weight B; this, in the opinion of the adversaries. would prove that no
power has a special maximum of its own (p. 138, l. 38 to p. 139‚ l. 0).
Wyclif answers here at great length (pp. 152-162), giving many (liffe-
rent senses of the word ‘difficulty’; but we need not go 111101110111. The
gist of his reply (p. 159, l. 4—10) is that the notion of a maximum
must here be considered with regard to the time, and not apart. We
may, however, in this long and discursive reply, note several striking
sentences, some paradoxical, some quaint, and some proving a con-
siderable knowledge of mechanics‚ as then known. “Of all difficult
things — i. e. of those which deteriorale the agent that does them —
mortal sin is the most difficult (p. 155, l. 26, 27>.³’ “In the sense of
esomething to be mastered³, the universe is a difficulty to God Himself
(p. 156, l. 20—25).’³ “Withont God's aid we should find it as difficult
to move a bean as to make a world (p. 157, 1. 29—31J).³' c‘In the act
of sustaining, much depends on the manner of application of the weight‚
An egg will not be crushed even by a considerable force; a sail will
bear up against a strong wind; and experiments with levers prove this
abundantly and in a marvellous way (multa . . . mirabilia facere, p. 160,
l. 25—34).” “The least weight a man cannot 511513111 15 1110 greatest
that he can (p. 160, 1, 34—37),³’ “Weight implies distance from the
centre‚ or from the proper sphere of each element; water in its own
sphere has no weight, as divers tell 115, and Ι suppose that it is the
same for the earth too (p. 161, l. 14—16).’³

4, The biggest or the smallest man possible is impossible. If the
former got a bump (tunsionem), he would then be too big to exist. If
the latter lost a hair (quamlibet ablationem partis superfluae), he would
be too small. — This humorous argument is answered on p. 167
(l. 34 Sa seq.) where it 15 pointed ont that, though the greatest possible
giant could not assimilate any more food, so long as his body remained
of that size, a swelling would not render his (γη-03111501, 35 3 living body,
any the larger. And a similar train of reasoning would apply to the
smallest dwarf. But before 11115 reply, we come to 3 very interesting
digression (pp. 162-166). Wyclif, admitting a minimum of size for all
bodily substances‚ implicitly asserts the existence of 3101115 from the very
ontset (minima naturalia; p. 162, l. 11); and 3 few pages later, he openly

gives thern their right name (athomorum 0. 166, l. 32). Itis too ge-
