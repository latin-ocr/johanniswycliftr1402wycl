XL INTRODUCTION.

student will no doubt find Vitellio’s works in any great library. — One
of Wyclif's mistakes struck me. He denies that the visual rays cross
each other in the centre of the eye. If they did, he says, they would
form an inz'erled image! This shows how little philosophers of that time
cared for experimenta] tests3 for nothing would have been 635161, even
then, than to examine the image formed and find out that it really was
inverted (p. 175, l. 22 to end of ch. Vll),

Chapter VIII. Of Conditional propositions. VVyclis deals rather
more at length with them than with the others3 but he soon turns away
to the problem of individuation‚ and thence to the question of the so-
called Insolubles.

Logicians generally hold 11131 such 3 proposition 35, JfA is B, C
is D, does not posit the existence of anything‚ but merely affirms a
connection between two propositions (p. 186, l. 14—16). Wyelif denies
this rule, though granting that it possesses 311 6161116111 of truth (l. 23 - 31)
Every proposition of this kind is either necessary or impossible. If ne-
cessary, its truth implies God's existence, on whom 311 truth depends;
if impossible, it implicitly denies 11131 He exists. Here occur some details
about necessary truth. A truth may be 31 different times both true and
false; and even 31 1116 111116 when it is false, its having· been fruc is 311
eternal truth. The signification of thf¹ present may be extended to the

But, what individualizes such propositions 35 :l will ΖΨ. IMIS. can

various circumstances to be true, whilst another of exactly the same

time3 and it changes accordingly (p. 189, l 16 to p. 190, Ι. 3). But if
so, this would infer 3 continual change in truth; nothing would remain
