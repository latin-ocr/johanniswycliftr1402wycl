It would be a false argument to say: “Manhood is a thing identical with
Socrates and with Plato: therefore, Socrates is Plato.³² In like manner,
to say: “Being is God and is Not-God; therefore God is Not-God’' ——
is false too (p. 38, l. 10-34). We may say: “leat which (meaning, or
as Wyelif says7 pointing 111, demonstrans, Transcendental Being) is Not-
God is G0d;³³ but we cannot inser thence that the creature is God
(pp. 38, 39). But to admit even the former proposition seems perilously
near Pantheism: so we must not be surprised if Wyclif reverts to this
point and supports his distinction with analogies drawn from the pro-
foundest mysteries of the Christian religion.

Third. To grant that the Universal Man is identical with each of
its singulars seems to imply its doing and being all that every individual
does and is. It is thus at the same time awake and asleep, white and
black‚ ἂψ, together with countless other contradictory attributes (p. 39,
l. 38 to end; p. 40, l. 1—14). This objection may be solved either nega-
tively oi· in the affirmative. Man is that which is white and that which
is black; but Man is not white and black. For, as a universal, this term
can receive no predicates but such as are essential to human nature:
and it is evident that neither whiteness nor blackness are thus essential
(p. 40, l. 15 to p. 42, l. ὁ). But again, taking ideal humanity as the
exemplar and prototype of each man, and consequently as the cause of
each, we may grant that it does every one of the actions of each. So
universals do receive accidents: not indeed in themselves, but in their
singulars, with which they are identical: and the countless different attri-
butes, which 316 or ma)¹ 116 contradictory in their singulars, are not so
in them (p. 42, l. 5—25). This explanation is similar to that of theolo-
gians, who deny that the Godhead suffered, although it was that which
suffered, i. e. the person of Christ (p. 42, l. 28 to p. 44, 1. 25). Several
other objections are propounded and solved in the same way, by pointing
either to the mystery of the Incarnation or to that of the Trinity; in the
latter, the essence of the Deity is 511115131111311)ν 1116 same in each of the
three person53 yet the Three are really distinct. The Father 15 not the Son,
although that iz'lticlz 15 the Father 15 llzat nvlziclz is the Son. “To every
sophism against Real Universals, you can find a parallel one against the
Holy 'l‘rinity‚'³ says Wyelif ip. 46, l. 18—22). Very true; and it there-
fore follows that, sm· cz Cltrisliun, the distinction is not meaningless,

meaningless as it 11131 seem, But the following would seem an obvious
